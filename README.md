# Bank Customer Churn Prediction
This project was for my Ai and Machine learning module during my MSc in Data Science.

Task 1: Machine Learning Pipeline

In this coursework you will apply what you have learnt in this module to solve real- world problems, both with classical machine learning and popular deep learning methods. The coursework has two tasks, the first task is about designing a pipeline (i.e., a standard procedure on data preliminary analysis, selection of ML methods, training and test data splitting, metrics selection and evaluation) to use ML to solve a predefined task

Design a pipeline, an evaluation strategy, and a set of experiments to determine the best parameters and machine learning algorithm, based on the results of empirical evaluations derived from a dataset (for achieving this, you could compare different algorithms if needed). Data used for this task: A business manager of a consumer credit card portfolio is facing the problem of customer attrition. They want to analyse the data to find out the reason behind this and leverage the same to predict customers who are likely to drop off.

Multiple attributes have been provided about the customers information along with demographics.

Features: • Client number. Unique identifier for the customer holding the account. • Demographic variable - Customer's Age in Years. • Demographic variable – Gender M=Male, F=Female. • Demographic variable - Number of dependents. • Demographic variable - Educational Qualification of the account holder (example: high school, college graduate) • Demographic variable – Marital_Status: Married, Single, Divorced, Unknown. • Demographic variable - Annual Income Category of the account holder (< 40K - 60K, 80K, 120K, > $120K, Unknown).

• Product Variable - Type of Card (Blue, Silver, Gold, Platinum). • Month on book - Period of relationship with bank. • Total relationship count: Total no. of products held by the customer. • Months inactive: No. of months inactive in the last 12 months • No. of Contacts in the last 12 months. • Credit Limit on the Credit Card. • Total Revolving Balance on the Credit Card. • Open to Buy Credit Line (Average of last 12 months). • Change in Transaction Amount (Q4 over Q1). • Total Transaction Amount (Last 12 months). • Total Transaction Count (Last 12 months). • Change in Transaction Count (Q4 over Q1) • Average Card Utilization Ratio. • Attrition Flag. Internal event (customer activity) variable - if the account is closed then 1 else 0.

Inspiration
Predict whether a customer is likely to cancel his account.
